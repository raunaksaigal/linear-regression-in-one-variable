# linear-regression-in-one-variable

This is a project that I have built after learning linear regression in one varialble.
 
The housing.csv dataset consists of housing prices in and across US. I then train a linear regression model on the dataset by running a gradient descent algorithm on it.
 The way it works is - 

 - We try to fit a linear curve through the set of points given in the dataset
 - Upon taking a random but calculated value for w and b for fitting the equation `y=w*x+b` 
 - The we calculate the deviation of the curve from the actual values and try to minimise the error through gradient descent.
